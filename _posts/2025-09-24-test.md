The first iteration of the programming jig was not pressing against the pads well enough. I think I need to make the bumps larger so that they actually contact the pads. I'm going to try a couple different sizes by varying the conic curve number in my CAD program. 

The microchip technologies TPI (tiny programming interface) is a 2 wire serial interface used to program the flash memory on-board the AT-Tiny20 used as the brains of my business card. 
This protocol samples the data line on the falling edge of the clk pin, and is sent in 12 bit packets consisting of a start bit (always low), 8 data bits (least significant first), a parity bit and two stop bits (both high). 
I will be using an Ardunio UNO as the programming interface for this project, and will be writing a simple script to upload to the controllers flash memory. 

The first step is writing the ISP programmer, which involves implementing the necessary instruction, as well as a serial interface so that it can be more easily controlled from a computer
